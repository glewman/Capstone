        I created this app to be an organizational tool that helps you track any and all changes you would make to your home aquarium and document the outcomes. One thing I've learned over the years is that there are so many different things that go into a healthy aquarium, and all of them require their own maintenance at different times. I wanted to come up with a more mobile, convenient way to keep track of all of these things beyond an unorganized notebook. Thus, an idea was born.
